# Banking Marketing Campaign Project

**Business Insight

Long-term deposits allow banks to hold money for a specific period of time, allowing the bank to use that money to enhance its investments. Marketing campaigns for this product are based on phone calls. If a user is not available at a given time, then they will be called back at another time.

**Description of the problem

The Portuguese bank is experiencing a decline in revenue, so they want to be able to identify existing customers who are more likely to take out a long-term deposit. This will allow the bank to focus their marketing efforts on those customers and avoid wasting money and time on customers who are unlikely to sign up.

To address this problem we will create a ranking algorithm to help predict whether or not a customer will sign up for a long-term deposit.
